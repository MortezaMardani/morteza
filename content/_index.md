## 🧠 About Me

I am a **Principal Scientist** at [**NVIDIA Fundamental Generative AI Research (GenAIR)**](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/genair/) and a **Visiting Researcher** at **Stanford University**.

My research focuses on building the **algorithmic foundations of generative AI**—ranging from **diffusion/flow models** to **physics-aware generation**.

My work bridges theory and practice of generative learning to advance generative AI. I am deeply interested in both algorithmic/theoretical foundations of generative modeling, and its real-world applications across **content creation**, **graphics**, **digital twins**, **science**.

At NVIDIA, I lead core research on developing **diffusion/flow-based foundation models** for **scientific AI**, including digital twin of Earth for climate and weather simulations. I led the development of weather foundation models that have been integrated into NVIDIA products and adopted by major customers such as **The Weather Channel**.

## 📍 Bio

I earned my PhD in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from the **University of Minnesota**, advised by **Georgios Giannakis**, focusing on statistical learning and optimization.

I was a **Visiting Scholar** at **UC Berkeley’s RISE Lab** with **Michael Mahoney**, and later a **Postdoc and Research Associate at Stanford**, working with **David Donoho**, **John Pauly**, and **Shreyas Vasanawala** on inverse problems and generative models.

I serve as an **IEEE SPS Distinguished Industry Speaker**, a member of the **IEEE Computational Imaging Technical Committee**, and am a recipient of the **IEEE SPS Young Author Best Paper Award**.
